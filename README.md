- I am NautAstro, and i am a college GameDev student from Brasil!
- I’m interested in Games, Game Development, Game Design Theory and Practice, and in Programming. I yearn to become a full-time GameDev in the future, be it as an indie dev with a team, or in a studio;
- I’m currently learning Game Design Principles and the Godot Game Engine, aside from college subjects, that is. I am willing to get Game Development experience through small projects, too;
- I am looking to take part in game jams, and to pick up small game and programming projects to boost my learning, as well as to be able to publish games soon;
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a bit of what they would call a "metalhead", but I like any kind of music, I just can't get enough of it!
